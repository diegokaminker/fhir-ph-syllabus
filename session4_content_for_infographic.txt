BLOCK 1 – FHIR REFERENCES
1. Why references?
2. Reference Types
3. Example with an Immunization record

No quizz in this block, just an assignment!

References between resources
• One resource is usually not enough
• We need to use

location

– multiple resources
– represent the relations

In FHIR this is called
"Reference"

patient

Immunization

performer

encounter

manufacturer

Types of References in FHIR (1)
• Absolute (ref.resource is in specific server)
<subject>
<reference value="http://myserver/fhir/Patient/20911">
</subject>

• Relative (ref.resource is in same server)
<subject>
<reference value="Patient/20911">
</subject>

Types of References in FHIR (2)
• Contained (ref.resource is in the same resource, like XML Ref)
<contained>
<Patient>
<id value="MyPatient">
…
</Patient>
</contained>

<subject>
<reference value="#MyPatient">
</subject>

Types of References in FHIR (3)
• Identifier (Reference by human identifier, not a FHIR ref)
<subject>
<identifier>
<system value="2.16.840.1.113883.2.10.4.2"/>
<value value="99999999"/>
</identifier>
<subject>

Type of Reference in FHIR (4)
• Bundled (Ref. Resource is in the same Bundle)
<Bundle>
<entry fullUrl="urn:uuid:d8497ab9-b5c14cfa-971c-7b4db9dc011a">
<Patient>
…
</Patient>
</entry>
…

<entry fullUrl="urn:uuid:d8497ab9-b5c14cfa-971c-7b4db9dc011a">
<Immunization>
…
<patient>
<reference value= "Patient/d8497ab9b5c1-4cfa-971c-7b4db9dc011a"
</patient>
</Immunization>
</entry>
…
</Bundle>

Contained Resources
• When there is no external identity
• Has limitations
– No reuse
– Very hard to ‘resolve’ to ‘real’
• Use when you must include information with no
independent ‘existence’

Example: Recording an Immunization
• Patient: Martin Smith, born 4/3/2019
• Administered, Feb 21,2025 10.30hs by Nurse Eve Admin,
NPI 20293
• Encounter: Ambulatory
–

Location: Good Health Clinic, 100 Main St., Ann Arbor,
Michigan

• Vaccine: Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Acellular Pertussis (DTaP),
CVX#20
• (product: Daptacel by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. , 1 Discovery Drive
Swiftwater, PA 18370, USA)
• Dose: 5th dose / Lot Number: 20191/88

BLOCK 2 – FHIR TERMINOLOGY
1. Introduction to Terminology
2. Binding
3. Terminology Services
4. Terminology Operations

WE WILL ASK 6 QUESTIONS DURING THIS
BLOCK – BE AWARE

Terminology in FHIR
• Key to semantic interoperability: dealing with coded
elements and the meaning of concepts.
• Interoperability = syntax + structure + semantics

Structure

Semantics

Fragment from http://www.hl7.org/fhir/Observation.html

Examples of Coded Data in FHIR
– code Datatype

• e.g. Patient gender = “male”
– CodeableConcept Datatype
• e.g. Observation code for a Blood Glucose measurement:
LOINC = “2339-0” (Glucose [Mass/volume] in Blood)
Displayed as Glucose, Blood
– Quantity Datatype
• Units of measure for the Blood Glucose measurement:

80 UCUM units = mg/dL

Binding Strength
• How closely the options in the value set should be followed
• Values
– Required

(must come from set)

– Extensible

(may use alternate if have to)

– Preferred

(don’t have to, but should)

– Example

(set isn’t specified)

• Can use a profile to vary
– Make stronger not weaker

Let's discuss with an example (1)
• A brand new agency, called Fictitious Office for Control
of Animal Behaviour (FOCAB), requires prompt reporting
of some specific problems related to animals injuring
humans
• The FHIR IG involves using a resource with a code
(CodeableConcept) element.
• It will be used to represent "what happened".
• EHRs can report code to FOCAB using either SNOMED
CT or ICD-10.

Let's discuss with an example (2)
These are the codes requiring report to FOCAB
CodeSystem

CODES FROM ICD-10
All
codes descendant of:
(http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10)

CODES FROM SNOMED CT
All
the descendants (is-a) of
(http://snomed.info/sct)

W53 - Contact with rodent
W54 – Contact with dogs
W55 – Contact with other mammals
W56 – Contact with non venomous sea animal
W57 – Contact with non venomous insect or arthropods
W58 – Contact with crocodrile or alligator
W59 – Contact with non venomous reptiles
W61 – Contact with domestic birds
W62 - Contact with non–venomous amphibians
T63 - Toxic effect of contact with venomous animals

'Bite of a non-human animal':782162007 (is-a: 782162007)
'Accidental physical contact with animal': 418589001 (is-a
418589001)

ValueSet

We created a new ValueSet called
http://focab.gov/fhirig/ValueSet/focuscodes
which includes all these codes from
SNOMED CT and ICD-10
This ValueSet has two functions:
- Know when to report to FOCAB
(detection triggers report)
- Validate code. Only these codes are valid

Let's discuss with an example (3): Questions
For each code in this list
Discuss if it is valid for the FOCAB FHIR IG or not

Terminology Services on FHIR
• Provides ‘services’ for consumers to access terminology
– Hide the complex stuff from a consumer

• Uses Operations framework
– Get definition for a concept
– Find a concept
• Within a ValueSet

http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/terminology-service.html

Terminology Servers
• Lots of Complexity

– Code Systems
– Value Sets
– Bindings
• Most applications are much simpler in capacities and needs.
– Usually lists of codes shown in a table

• A terminology server concentrates the complexity in only one
system, that can even be a third party service.

Application needs
• Give me a list of codes
• ¿Is this code valid?
• ¿How do I show this concept?
• Translate this code into another code system
• Integrate terminology search into my app

Terminology Operations (FHIR)
• $expand – obtain expansion for a valueset
• $lookup – given code/valueset, give display
• $validate-code – ¿is it valid? (including subsumption test)
• $translate – translate this into another code system

US Terminology – Use Cases and Domain
(Main Use)
• LOINC: lab tests, document sections, vital signs
• SNOMED CT: problems, diagnostics, allergies
• RXNORM: medication (products and drugs)
• CVX: Vaccine codes
• CPT: Procedures
• ICD-10 CM: conditions

PH Terminology – Main Repository
• UMLS
• CVX
• OMB: Race, Ethnicity
• VSAC - NIH
Terminology Server :
Public Health
– OIDs?

Model of data…

Why is HL7 V2-to-FHIR Conversion Important
• HL7 V2.x is still the lingua franca of healthcare, despite all
its dialects (different versions and sui generis utilization and
implementation)
• If you want ALL the clinical information from a site or group
of site as input for a FHIR based clinical repository, the
easiest way is to 'listen' to existing information flows, and
they are usually implemented as HL7 V2 feeds: ADT, Lab
Results, Immunizations.

How it is done
• There is an official mapping for the most common HL7 V2
messages (ADT, Orders, Results, Scheduling)
• https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/v2-to-fhir/
• IT IS NOT A TOOL: it's a mapping.
• Is it a definitive mapping? NO. Why? because each HL7
V2 implementation can be opinionated, extended, etc. It's
very common to implement a custom script to tackle the
specifics. Sorry

Some tools for mapping
• FUME
• Microsoft FHIR
Converter
• Mirth Connect
Tools to convert instances of
HL7V2.x, CDA R2 or custom
formats from/to FHIR
JSON/XML

Mapping: FUME
FUME

https://try.fume.health/

FUME is a FHIR conversion and transformation engine, designed to enable any data
analyst to express FHIR-related data conversions in an easy, compact and expressive
syntax.
FUME was created by a company from Israel called Outburn.

Can connect to a FHIR server that enables it to be used as a repository for saved FUME
mappings & translation tables. Uses FHIR-oriented functions that assist in the
transformation to or from FHIR resources. Has a RESTful API to run the transformation
against a JSON, XML, CSV or HL7 V2 input
35

Mapping : FHIR Converter
FHIR-Converter https://github.com/microsoft/FHIR-Converter
• Open-source project that enables conversion of health data from legacy
formats to and from FHIR. The FHIR converter uses the Liquid template
language and the .NET runtime.
• The FHIR converter supports the following conversions: HL7v2 to
FHIR, C-CDA to FHIR, JSON to FHIR, FHIR STU3 to R4, and FHIR to
HL7v2 (Preview).
• Also available as API operation in the Azure based FHIR store

36

Mapping : Mirth Connect
Mirth Connect

https://github.com/nextgenhealthcare/connect

Mirth Connect translates message standards into the one your system
understands. Whenever a "foreign" system sends you a message,
Mirth Connect's integration capabilities expedite the following:
• Filtering — Mirth Connect reads message parameters and passes the
message to or stops it on its way to the transformation stage.
• Transformation — Mirth Connect converts the incoming message
standard to another standard (e.g., HL7 to XML).
• Extraction — Mirth Connect can "pull" data from and "push" data to
a database.
• Routing — Mirth Connect makes sure messages arrive at their
assigned destinations.
• Users manage and develop channels (message pathways) using the
interface known as the Administrator
