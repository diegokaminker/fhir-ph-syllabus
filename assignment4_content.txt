HL7 V2.5.1 Implementation Guide from Maine
The implementation guide is available from here:
https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/immunizati
on/documents/ImmPact-HL7v2.5.1DataExchangeSpecs-v0.3-ME9.2020.pdf
Our organization needed to transform the immunization
messages into FHIR to feed a clinical decision support system.

Proposed Mapping
One of the big consultancy companies (in fact, one of the big 7)
sent a 18yo trainee who after three months asking questions and
writing notes in an ipad, finally asked ChatGPT to create a
template with the mapping from the HL7 V2.x message to a FHIR
Message Bundle, and a table with the mapping, to help the
implementers.
The results are below:

Standard Mapping
There is a standardized mapping defined in the V2-to-FHIR
implementation guide here:
https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/v2-to-fhir/ConceptMap-message-vxu-v04-to
-bundle.html

Mapping Playground
You can also use the FHIR Mapping Playground at
https://diegokaminker.github.io/mapping_playground/mapping.html

Your Job
Your job is to discuss some draft solutions for the problems -not
all of them, there are more- with the mapping created by our
trainee (and ChatGPT)

Hints from An Expert
An initial list of problems was created by an HL7 FHIR HL7 V2.x
expert but he retired and is now living on a private island in Bermuda.
He faxed some handwritten notes.

(Two days after leaving, he also recorded a message in our answering
machine (we have one from the 90s): “Something happens with the
manufacturer. Yes, please, another mojito”)

Preliminary Analysis
Let’s review each problem the HL7 Expert has pin-pointed, and you
can suggest how to fix it

1.​ “Review the gender”

A)​This is gender element definition as found in the FHIR R4
Patient spec.

B)​This is the definition in HL7 table 0001 for Administrative
Sex from the spec from Maine:

​
Discuss a proposed fix

2.​ “Something is wrong about the Location”

A)​The location element in the Immunization resource is
populated through the map as follows:
"location": {
"reference": "Location/{{MSH.4}}"}
B)​The problem is that both MSH.4 (Sending Facility) and
RXA.11 (Administered-At Location) only contain a code for
the Facility, so
i) the reference is pointing to a resource which is not in the
Bundle
ii) We do not have any actual information on the location
Hint: Read the Messaging Profile…where are the locations
defined? How is this information used?
Discuss proposed fixes

3.​ “Review code systems and identifier.system”

A)​Examples of Code Systems and System identifiers for HL7
V2.x
NPI identifier, assigned by CMS:

Code from CDC for Race

Code from CVX for Immunization

B)​Required Structure and System identifiers in FHIR (same
examples)
i) How to identify a practitioner using NPI in FHIR (
https://terminology.hl7.org/3.1.0/NamingSystem-npi.html)
"identifier":[{
"system" = "http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-npi",
"value" = "1245319599"}]

ii) How to specify CDC terminology for Race
(https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-race.
html​ )

"valueCoding" : {
"system" : "urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.6.238",
"code" : "2106-3",
"display" : "White"}

Note: this introduces another interesting mapping problem: in HL7 V2.x, Race is
part of the demographic data for the patient, in FHIR, it is an extension defined in
US Core!

ii) How to include a CVX code from Immunization (
https://terminology.hl7.org/3.1.0/CodeSystem-CVX.html)
"vaccineCode": {
"coding": [
{
"system": "http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/cvx",
"code": "08",
"display": "HEPB-PEDIATRIC/ADOLESCENT"
}
]}

Discuss proposed fixes

4.​ “Pay Attention to Date-Time Formats”

A)​The date format in HL7 V2.x / from the Maine spec
(example):
MSH-7: Date/time of message
The date and time the message was created.
This field is required.
Format: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS If sending more than 14
digits, the following format is required:
YYYY[MM[DD[HH[MM[SS[.S[S[S[S]]]]]]]]][+/-ZZZZ]
Example: 19970716192030.45+0100

B) The Date/Time Formats in FHIR are as follows ( date,
dateTime ):
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
DateTime: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+zz.zz

Discuss proposed fixes

5.​ “Take care of internal Bundle references”
References to resources inside of the same Bundle should be created using urn:uuid to
allow the server solve the creation/update of resources
Each resource in a Bundle should contain an entry identifier (fullUrl) and a criteria in the
url to add or update the contained resource. All references in the Bundle should point to the
fullUrl of the referenced entry.
{
"fullUrl": "urn:uuid:25131980-1b95-4548-a01d-94786b40e4c6",
"request": {
"method": "PUT",
"url":
"Patient?identifier=http://imm-messages.gov/MyEMR-DE-000004/patients|AD445566
"
},
… (in a resource related to the above)
"reference": "urn:uuid:25131980-1b95-4548-a01d-94786b40e4c6"
…

Discuss proposed fixes
6.​ “Something happens with the manufacturer”
As some other data in the HL7 V2.x => FHIR template, the manufacturer was not
included in the actual mapping.
